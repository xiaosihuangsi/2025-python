Continue Practice Demo of <code>break</code> to exit loops early and <code>continue</code> to skip iterations. 9 Loop-Else Prime Checker Demonstrates the use of <code>else</code> with loops to identify prime numbers. 10 Pass Statement Demo Demonstrates Python's <code>pass</code> statement as a placeholder in loops, classes, and functions. 11 Match Statement Demo Demonstrates Python 3.10+ structural pattern matching."},{"location":"#about-the-author","title":"\ud83d\udc64 About the Author","text":"<p>Created and maintained by Xiaosi Huang, an enthusiastic Python learner and builder who believes that the best way to learn is to make things.</p> <p>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f This project is part of an ongoing journey to build 100+ Python mini-projects as a way to practice and share.</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 You can explore more of their work at: \ud83d\udd17 github.com/xiaosihuangsi</p>"},{"location":"projects/break_continue/","title":"Break &amp;
