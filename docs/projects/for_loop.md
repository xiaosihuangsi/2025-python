# For Loop Practice Tool

The **For Loop Practice Tool** demonstrates list and dictionary iteration using Python `for` loops.  
It helps visualize how data structures like lists and dictionaries can be traversed and filtered.

## How to Use

You’ll be prompted to choose one of two demos:

1. **List Loop Demo**  
    Enter a comma-separated list of words.  
    The tool will display each word and its length.

2. **Dictionary Loop Demo**  
    A predefined dictionary of users and statuses will be shown.  
    The tool will then filter and print only the active users.
