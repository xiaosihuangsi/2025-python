# Break & Continue Practice Tool

This tool demonstrates how the `break` and `continue` statements work in Python loops:

- `break`: exits the loop entirely when a condition is met.
- `continue`: skips the current iteration and continues to the next.

---

## How to Use

1. Run the tool.
2. Choose a demo:
- **1**: Find the first divisor of numbers from 2 to 9 (break demo).
- **2**: Filter and display even and odd numbers (continue demo).

3. Observe the output for each control flow behavior.

## Example

### Demo 1: Find first divisor with `break`

```text
2 is a prime number
3 is a prime number
4 equals 2 * 2
5 is a prime number
6 equals 2 * 3
7 is a prime number
8 equals 2 * 4
9 equals 3 * 3
```


### Demo 2: Filter even/odd using continue

```text
Found an even number: 2
Found an odd number: 3
Found an even number: 4
Found an odd number: 5
Found an even number: 6
Found an odd number: 7
Found an even number: 8
Found an odd number: 9
```
