# Range Practice Tool

The **Range Practice Tool** helps you understand how Python's built-in `range()` function works. It generates a sequence based on `start`, `end`, and `step` values you provide, then performs a quick analysis on the sequence.

---

## How to Use

1. Run the tool.
2. Enter:
    A **start** value (e.g., `0`)
    An **end** value (e.g., `10`)
    A **step** value (e.g., `2`)

3. The tool will:
    Generate a list using `range(start, end, step)`
    Display the sequence
    Show the sum and length of the sequence

## Example

```bash
Start: 1
End: 10
Step: 3

Generated sequence: [1, 4, 7]
Sum of values: 12
Length: 3
```
