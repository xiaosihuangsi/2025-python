# Word Counter Tool

The **Word Counter Tool** reads a text file or input string and counts the number of words it contains. This is useful for quick analysis, content validation, or basic natural language processing.

---

## How to Use

You can run the tool by executing the Python script directly, or by selecting it from the tool hub interface.

It accepts either:
- a text input via the terminal
- or a `.txt` file path as an argument

The tool will then return the **total word count**.

## Example

```bash
Enter text or file path: Hello world, this is a test.
Word count: 6
```

## File Location

```bash
Path: word_counter_tool/word_counter.py
```
