# Python Lab

Welcome to the Python Lab!  
This repository contains a growing collection of hands-on Python mini-projects, tools, and exercises, built to strengthen programming skills and explore various topics.

Each project is organized into its own independent, modular folder for clarity and scalability.  
The goal is to develop over 100 practical mini-projects across different areas.
