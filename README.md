# 🐍 Python Lab

Welcome to **Python Lab** — an evolving collection of hands-on Python mini-projects, tools, and exercises to sharpen programming skills and explore various domains!

Each project is organized into its own independent, modular folder for clarity and scalability.  
The long-term goal is to develop over 100+ practical mini-projects across different areas.
